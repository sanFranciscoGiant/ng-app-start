- hyphens used in different section linke on "th_03-Cardinal-Care-is-everywhere-Detail.jpg" italic text, works on iPhone (all browser), android/desktop (all browser except chrome).
So please ignore hypen issues on chrome.

-------------
- viewed notification: If "OK" is clicked in the 'exhibit alert' modal on welcome page then it navigates 'exhibitAlert:105 (Interactive video Wall)' & marks this alter as viewed. Now it we go to '#/notifications' page this will be marked as viewed (ticked). 
Also on refreshing the page the viewed state gets cleard.

----------------
Please ignore validation error due to vendor specific CSS '@-webkit-keyframes'. It's used as a fallback CSS and responsible for animation when modal appears.

Thanks.
